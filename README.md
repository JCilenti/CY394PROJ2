CY394 Cloud Computing Final Project

******* Barracks Barbershop *******

Requirements: 
Python3
Django
Postgres DB
Docker
Cloud Service of Choice (For Deployment)

Purpose: 
The barracks barber business is bearing bold bargaining opportunities for Cadets in the
United States Military Academy. However, there is really no way for a barber to get started
with networking unless they personally know their customers. It is difficult to schedule and
maintain said schedule with their customers. Enter our Barracks Barber web application. Our
goal is to bring barbers and those looking for a haircut together as quickly and seamlessly 
as possible. 

How:
To create the best system possible for the users, we decided to create a web application
using Django. We then use a Postgres Database to store our user base and other necessary 
data that needs to be logged. Using the Heroku cloud service, we will deploy the production
version of our application so that it is live. For the scheduling of events and rating
barbers, we utilize several django packages. For payment, we use a PayPal and/or Venmo button 
to make the payment process easy.
